# Developer Journal

### 09/16/2019
Began Node.js tutorials to get a better understanding of how to develop browser based web app.

### 09/18/2019
Met with project teammates and decided on using React for front-end development and Firebase for our back-end development. Read documentation on Firebase and its capabilities. Created a test project in Firebase to get a better understanding of 

### 09/23/2019
Began doing React tutorials. Went through the entire ‘Getting Started’ tutorial. Learned commands to create and start a web app locally. Built a small web app to use as a Sandbox

### 09/24/2019
Built simple UML diagram using draw.io for the Spike Exercise (Detailed at bottom of journal). Can also be found within the project as SpikeExcercise.jpg

### 09/25/2019
At our team meeting officially decided we would build our semester project as a mobile app. As a result, I began reading up on React native.

### 09/26/2019
Set up project using React Native and using Expo as a way to build the project and then emulate it on an iPhone.

### 09/27/2019
Developed the Login screen for the UW-Live Well App. Created login screen with all possible routes as specified in write-up and UML document.

### 09/30/2019
Created a GitHub repository for my UW-Live Well mobile app. Wanted to do this so I could get better practice with using Git as my version control system. Importing developer journal so that I can also make commits to the README file.  Watched tutorials on how to connect my React Native app to Firebase. Installed Firebase into my React project. Added ability to 'Create Account' and 'Continue as a Guest' from the main login page.

### 10/01/2019
Configured the database configuration in React js. Able to insert first test data into Firebase database. That data was inserted into two tables, one for user and one for the added houses. Created the page for Account Creation. Created page for adding a new house. Created new dashboard page for the user's to see when they log in as registered user or guest. Need to watch more tutorials on React Naviagation so I know how to connect button clicks with component changes. Need more research on how to select from Firebase database using React.

### 10/02/2019
Watched Linkedin Learning - Learning React Native to get better understanding of how I can properly navigate different screens in my mobile app. Decided to restart my ios mobile app as my first attempt was really unorganized which made it difficult to navigate my app. I have imported the 'react-navigation' package which gives me access to the StackNavigator and SwitchNavigator. Using this package I was able to get the app to switch screens based on user interaction. I then moved styling code from my old workspace to my new workspace.

### 10/03/2019
I met with Jonathan to get some help on some navigation issues I was experiencing as well as some issues with Firebase. He was able to show me some ways that I could easily authenticate login and signup using Firebase API. I implemented a new login and sign up function for the respective screens, however I have been unable to see the login and sign up data reflected in the Firebase console.

### 10/04/2019
Worked on figuring out my bug with the login screen. I'm using Firebase's API to authenticate the login as well as sign up user's and for some reason it's not working at all. Though I didn't complete the project I am pretty happy with the amount of knowledge that I was able to learn on my own. Coming into this project I had very little experience with JavaScript and no experience with React Native. Then without having any experience with Firebase backend being able to connect that to my front-end which was really cool, and gave me a lot of confidence in our semster project moving forward.

# Conclusion
Though this project felt very overwhelming I was able to get past a lot of the stress and frustration by making my main goal to focus on learning something new. For me that new thing was React Native. Not having any experience in React Native made it very difficult to get started right away.  I wanted to approach this Spike Excercise the same way I have past programming projects where I can just jump in and start right away. However, given the size of this project and I really had to slow myself down and take the time to go through tutorials and get a better understanding of how to develop with React Native. I will say that I am happy with the amount I was able to get done. I'm more happy about the fact that I was able to be challenged and was able to come out with a new knowledge in React Native, Firebase, Expo, and Git. I stated it earlier but this Spike Excercise did make me hopeful for our project going forward I think I'll be able to contribute a lot more to my team now then I would have before doing this excercise.
